Yes, the provided YAML defines a **`ScaledObject`** using KEDA, which will enable auto-scaling for the `example-app` deployment based on a custom trigger (`predictkube` in this case). 

However, this configuration **does not directly create a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**. Instead, it creates a KEDA `ScaledObject`, which internally manages the scaling of the `example-app` based on the provided Prometheus metrics and other trigger parameters. KEDA will create an HPA behind the scenes to handle the scaling.

### Explanation of the key parts:

1. **TriggerAuthentication**:
   - Provides authentication for the `predictkube` trigger using a Kubernetes secret (`predictkube-secrets`), which contains the `apiKey`.

2. **ScaledObject**:
   - **`scaleTargetRef`**: Refers to the Kubernetes resource (in this case, `example-app`) that will be scaled.
   - **`minReplicaCount`** and **`maxReplicaCount`**: Specifies the minimum and maximum number of replicas for scaling.
   - **`triggers`**: The `predictkube` trigger uses Prometheus metrics to trigger scaling decisions. In this case, it looks at the rate of `http_requests_total` and scales based on a threshold of 2000 requests.

### Key points:
- The **`ScaledObject`** will trigger scaling using KEDA based on the specified Prometheus metric query.
- KEDA will create an HPA to manage the scaling of the `example-app`.
- **You do not need to manually create an HPA**. The ScaledObject automatically generates and manages the HPA.

After applying this YAML, KEDA will monitor the Prometheus metrics and scale the `example-app` based on the thresholds and configuration provided.

To monitor the scaling of your application managed by KEDA, you can use several methods to check both the state of the application and the metrics that drive the scaling decisions. Here’s how you can do that:

### 1. Check the Status of the ScaledObject

You can use `kubectl` to check the status of the `ScaledObject` and see how many replicas are currently running and if scaling actions have been triggered.

```bash
kubectl get scaledobject example-app-scaler -o yaml -n <namespace>
```

This command will provide details about the scaling configuration and the current state of the `ScaledObject`, including information about the triggers and the current replica count.

### 2. Check the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

Since KEDA manages scaling through an HPA, you can check the status of the HPA to see how it is scaling your application.

```bash
kubectl get hpa -n <namespace>
```

To get detailed information about a specific HPA, you can run:

```bash
kubectl describe hpa <hpa-name> -n <namespace>
```

This will give you insights into the current number of replicas, the metrics being monitored, and the thresholds for scaling.

### 3. Monitor Prometheus Metrics

Since your scaling is based on Prometheus metrics, you can monitor those metrics directly to see how they correlate with scaling actions:

- Access your Prometheus UI (if it’s deployed) and explore the metrics related to your application. 
- You can query metrics like `http_requests_total` to see how the request rates change over time.

### 4. Use KEDA Dashboard (if available)

KEDA may offer a dashboard or UI that can help visualize the scaling events, metrics, and status of your `ScaledObject`. Check the KEDA documentation or GitHub repository for any available tools.

### 5. Logs and Events

You can also check the logs of the KEDA operator and your application pods for any events or logs related to scaling actions:

- Check KEDA operator logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deployment/keda-operator -n keda
  ```

- Check your application pod logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
  ```

### 6. Monitoring Tools

Consider integrating monitoring tools like Grafana with Prometheus to visualize your metrics and scaling actions. You can create dashboards that display metrics related to your application’s performance and KEDA’s scaling behavior.

### Summary

By using these methods, you can effectively monitor the scaling behavior of your application managed by KEDA, ensuring it scales up or down based on demand while observing the metrics that trigger those scaling actions.
